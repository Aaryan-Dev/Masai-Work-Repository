// Sherlock has a matrix of dimension [nxm]. All the elements in this matrix are zero (Initialised as 0).

// Sherlock has q queries to execute on the matrix. Each query has two integers i.e, the type of query and the index.

// So if the type is 0, the index represents the index of row. Similarly, if the type is 1, the index represents the index of the column.

// Sherlock has to increase the value by 1 of all the elements that are present in that row or column depending on the type and index.

// In the end, after executing all queries, Sherlock is curious and wants to find the number of elements of the matrix which are odd (not divisible by 2).

// Note - 0-based indexing is followed here.
